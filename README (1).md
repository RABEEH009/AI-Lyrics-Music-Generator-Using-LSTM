# 🎵 AI-Powered Music and Lyrics Generator

> Generate **original melodies, lyrics, drums, and bass** instantly using **Deep Learning** and **Generative AI**.  
> Create mood-based songs and download your music — all through a simple web interface!

---

## 📜 Project Overview

Creating original music traditionally demands both creativity and technical expertise.  
Our project **democratizes music creation** by enabling anyone — regardless of musical background — to **compose complete songs** using AI.

**This system automatically**:
- Generates melodies with deep learning (LSTM models)
- Creates lyrics with Google Gemini API
- Adds drum and bass layers based on mood and style
- Lets users download their generated songs in `.mid` format

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🎶 **Melody Generation**: LSTM model predicts a sequence of musical notes.
- ✍️ **Lyrics Generation**: Gemini AI generates original lyrics matching your theme, mood, and style.
- 🥁 **Drums and Bass Tracks**: Rule-based system layers rhythmic instruments dynamically.
- 🌐 **Flask Web App**: Simple, user-friendly interface for real-time music and lyrics creation.
- 📥 **Download Option**: Users can download the final MIDI song directly.

## 📚 Dataset Used

- **Lakh MIDI Dataset**  
  > 176,581 MIDI files containing melodies, chords, and full songs.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - MIDI parsing with `pretty_midi`
  - Extract note sequences and encode them as integers
  - Normalize and structure data for LSTM input

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. User selects **Theme**, **Mood**, and **Style** on the web app.
2. Flask backend:
   - 🎵 Generates a melody (LSTM).
   - ✍️ Generates lyrics (Gemini API).
   - 🥁 Adds drums and bass tracks (rule-based).
3. The full song is created as a MIDI file.
4. User sees generated lyrics and can **download the music**!
